    📚 Books Notes
</h1>

<p align="center">
    Personal repository to organize my study notes from technical books and practice exercises.  
    Everything is written in Markdown and managed with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for easy navigation and backlinks.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to:

- Build a personal knowledge base for quick revision.
- Consolidate concepts in my own words.
- Keep track of my reading progress and exercises.

## 🗂️ Structure

```
books-notes/
├── abc/           # Notes and exercises from the book "abc"
├── xpto/          # Notes and exercises from the book "xpto"
└── concepts/      # Reusable notes about key concepts (may be separate by topics)
```

## 💡 How I Use It

- **Obsidian** is used as a local knowledge base (graph view, backlinks, search).
- After every study session, I commit & push the updated notes to this repository.
- Concepts are cross-linked so I can see connections between books and topics.

## 📖 Current Book(s)

- **Core Java, Volume I: Fundamentals** – Cay Horstmann
