The `ArrayList` class is similar to an array, but it automatically adjusts its capacity as you add and remove elements, without any additional code.

`ArrayList` is a _generic class_ with a _type parameter_. To specify the type of the element objects that the array list holds, you append a class name enclosed in angle brackets, such as `ArrayList<Employee>.
