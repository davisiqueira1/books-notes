It is possible to provide methods that can be called with a variable number of arguments. These are sometimes called "varargs" methods.

You have already seen such a method: `printf`. For example, the calls
```java
System.out.printf("%d", n);
```
and
```java
System.out.printf("%d %s", n, "widgets");
```

The `printf` method is defined like this:
```java
public class PrintStream {
	public PrintStream printf(String fmt, Object... args) {
		return format(fmt, args);
	}
}
```

Here, the ellipsis `...` is part of the Java code. It denotes that the method can receive an arbitrary number of objects (in addition to the `fmt` parameter).

The `printf` method actually receives two parameters: the format string and and `Object[]` array that holds all the other arguments.

You can define your own methods with variable arguments, and you can specify any type for the arguments, even a primitive type.
