The idea behind inheritance is that you can create new classes that are built on existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you reuse (or inherit) its methods, and you can add new methods and fields to adapt your new class to new situations.

Every inheritance relationship is a `"is-a" relationship`.
Example: every `manager` is an `employee`.
