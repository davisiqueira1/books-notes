The `Object` class is the ultimate ancestor: every class in Java extends `Object`. However, you never have to write `public class Employee extends Object`.

The ultimate superclass `Object` is taken for granted if no superclass is explicitly mentioned.

#### 5.2.1 Variables of Type Object

You can use a variable of type `Object` to refer to objects of any type:
```java
Object obj = new Employee(...);
```

In java, only the values of _primitive types_ (numbers, characters, and boolean values) are not objects.

All array types, no matter whether they are arrays of objects or arrays of primitive types, are class types that extend the `Object` class.

#### 5.2.2 The equals Method

The `equals` method in the `Object` class tests whether one object is considered equal to another. The `equals` method, as implemented in the `Object` class, determines whether two object references are identical. This is a pretty reasonable default: if two objects are identical, they should certainly be equal. For quite a few classes, nothing else is required.

> Note: the static method `Object.equals(a, b)` is `true` if both arguments are `null`, `false` if only one is `null`, and `a.equals(b)` otherwise. It is very useful for null safety.

When you define the `equals` method for a subclass, first call `equals` on the superclass. If that test doesn't pass, then the objects can't be equal. If the superclass fields are equal, you are ready to compare the instance fields of the subclass.

But remember: inside `super.equals(...)`, `this` is **still the runtime object** (e.g. a subclass instance).

If the superclass uses
```java
if (getClass() != otherObject.getClass()) {
	return false;
}
```
it performs a strict class check, so `super.equals` will return `false` if `this` and `otherObject` have different runtime classes, even if their fields match. To allow comparisons across subclasses, prefer using `instanceof` in the superclass `equals`.

> Note: Records automatically define an `equals` method that compares the fields defined in the _canonical constructor_. Two record instances are equal when the corresponding field values are equal.
