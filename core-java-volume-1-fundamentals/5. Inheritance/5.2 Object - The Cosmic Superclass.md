The `Object` class is the ultimate ancestor: every class in Java extends `Object`. However, you never have to write `public class Employee extends Object`.

The ultimate superclass `Object` is taken for granted if no superclass is explicitly mentioned.

#### 5.2.1 Variables of Type Object

You can use a variable of type `Object` to refer to objects of any type:
```java
Object obj = new Employee(...);
```

In java, only the values of _primitive types_ (numbers, characters, and boolean values) are not objects.

All array types, no matter whether they are arrays of objects or arrays of primitive types, are class types that extend the `Object` class.
