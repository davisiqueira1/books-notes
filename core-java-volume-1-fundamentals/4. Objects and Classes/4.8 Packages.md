Java allows you to group classes in a collection called a package. Packages are convenient for organizing your work and for separating your work from code libraries provided by others.

##### 4.8.1 Package Names

The main reason for using packages is to guarantee the uniqueness of class names. Suppose two programmers come up with the idea of supplying an `Point` class. As long as both of them place their class into different packages, there is no conflict.

##### 4.8.2 Class Importation

A class can use all classes from its own package and all public classes from other packages.

You can access the public classes in another package in two ways. The first is simply to use the fully qualified name; that is, the package name followed by the class name.

For example: 
```java
java.time.LocalDate today = java.time.LocalDate.now();
```

That is obviously tedious.

A simpler, and more common, approach is to use the import statement:
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
```

##### 4.8.5 Package Access

Features tagged as public can be used by any class. Private features can be used only by the class that defines them. If you donâ€™t specify either public or private, the feature (that is, the class, method, or variable) can be accessed by all methods in the same package.

##### 4.8.6 The Class Path

The classpath tells the Java compiler and JVM where to find classes and resources.

###### How it works:
- Compilation:
    `javac -classpath libs/* src/com/example/App.java`
- Execution:
    `java -classpath bin:libs/* com.example.App`
- Default value: the current directory (`.`).

###### Classpath components:
1. Directories containing compiled `.class` files (e.g., `bin/`, `out/`).
2. JAR files with external dependencies.
3. Source directories when compiling.

The JVM searches the classpath entries in order until it finds the required class.

##### 4.8.7 Setting the Class Path

Using the `-classpath` option is the preferred approach for setting the class path:
```bash
java -classpath /home/ user/ classdir:.:/ home/ user/ archives/ archive.jar MyProg
```

An alternate approach is the CLASSPATH environment variable.
```bash
export CLASSPATH =/ home/ user/ classdir:.:/ home/ user/ archives/ archive.jar
```

> This is generally a bad idea. People forget the global setting, and are surprised when their classes are not loaded properly.
