#### 4.3.8 Benefits of Encapsulation

I've always misunderstood the concept of setters and getters. In my mind, these methods break encapsulation per se.

"If a class has a field that can be modified and accessed through methods, isn't it the same as setting them as public?"

In short: no.

Take the class `Employee` as an example:
```java
class Employee {
	private String name;
	
	public Employee(String name) { this.name = name; }
	
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
}
```

The only way to modify the `name` attribute is through the `setName` method. So, if we find a case where the value ever turns out wrong, only that method needs to be debugged.

If our `name` attribute were public, any part of the code could modify it, so it would take longer to debug.

Only this should be enough to show us the importance of encapsulation, but let me show you another example. Imagine that our application now needs to store the name in two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`.

If the attribute `name` were public, we would need to check all the places where `employee.name` was accessed.

But with the `getName` method, we would only need to change its implementation to something like:
```java
public String getName() {
	return firstName + " " + lastName;
}
```

And that's the benefit of encapsulation: the internal logic is protected and isolated, allowing easier debugging and new feature implementation.
