In Java, the `static` keyword means belonging to the class, not to individual objects.

- Static Fields (Class Variables):
    - Shared across all instances of the class.
    - There is only one copy in memory.
    - Commonly used for counters, caches, or shared configuration.
    - Example:
	```java
		class Counter {
			static int count = 0;
		}
	```

- Static Methods:
    - Can be called without creating an object.
    - Cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly.
    - Often used for utility/helper functions.
    - Example:
    ```java
	    class MathUtils {
		    static int square(int x) {
			    return x * x;
			}
		}
    ```

- Static Constants:
    - Declared as `static final`, so they belong to the class and cannot change.
    - Conventionally written in UPPER_CASE.
    - Example:
	```java
		class Physics {
			static final double SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299_792_458;
		}
	```

- Factory Methods:
	- These are methods (often `static`) used to create instances of a class.
	- They make object creation clearer and more flexible, allowing logic or validation before returning an instance.
	- Commonly used instead of constructors when there are multiple ways to create an object.
	- Example:
	```java
		class Employee {
		    private String name;
		
		    private Employee(String name) {
		        this.name = name;
		    }
		
		    // Factory method
		    public static Employee of(String name) {
		        return new Employee(name.trim());
		    }
		}
	```
