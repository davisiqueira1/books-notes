#### 4.1.1 Classes

Initial discussion about encapsulation. Our classes must hide their information (properties and method implementations) by encapsulating them. The book calls it `"black box" behavior`: the user does not need to know the state of an object or how its class implements a method, it just needs to do what it is supposed to do.

To make encapsulation work, programs should interact with object data only through the object's methods. If an objectâ€™s state changes without a method call, there's something wrong with our class's encapsulation logic.

#### 4.1.4 Relationships between Classes

Most common relationships between classes are:
- Dependence ("uses-a")
- Aggregation("has-a")
- Inheritance("is-a")

##### Dependence ("uses-a")
The most obvious one. In the context of an order-processing system, the `Order` class uses the `Account` class because `Order` objects need to access `Account` objects to check for credit status.

Thus, a class depends on another class if its methods use or manipulate objects of that class, but it does not own them or maintain a long-term relationship.

This is a weak, temporary relationship, usually happening during a method call.

Example:

```java
class Order {
    public void process(Account account) {
        // Order depends on Account to do its job
        if (account.hasSufficientCredit(this)) {
            // Process it
        } else {
	        // Do something
        }
    }
}
```

##### Aggregation ("has-a")
A class aggregates another class if it contains references to objects that can still exist independently, even if the container is destroyed.

Example:

```java
class Order {
	private List<Item> items;
	
	public Order(List<Item> items) {
		this.items = items;
	}
}
```

##### Inheritance ("is-a")
A class inherits from another class when it reuses its attributes and behaviors, and may also define new attributes or override behaviors.

Example:

```java
class Order {
	public void process(Account account) {
		// Process
	}
}

class RushOrder extends Order {
	private Date expirationDate;
	
	@Override
	public void process(Account account) {
		// Process with priority
	}
}
```
