#### 4.2.2 Date and LocalDate Classes
- Date: represents a particular point in time by the number of milliseconds (positive or negative) from a fixed point, the so-called epoch, which is 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970
- LocalDate: represents the familiar calendar notation

Notice that the Java Library separates time measurement from calendar notation, since the same point in time can be represented in many ways depending on the calendar type you are using. Internally, LocalDate keeps a Date object to use as a reference for the point in time it is representing.

#### 4.2.3 Mutator and Accessor Methods
- Mutator method: changes the state of the object after the invocation
- Accessor method: only access objects without modifying them
